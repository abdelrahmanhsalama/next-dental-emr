# Next Dental EMR

This project demonstrates the three skill areas Iâ€™ve developed â€” frontend web development, which Iâ€™ve studied for nearly two years, health informatics, the field Iâ€™m determined to pursue, and data analysis, which plays a vital role in health informatics.

Next Dental EMR is a dental electronic medical records (EMR) application built with Next.js. It enables dental teams to manage patientsâ€™ records, appointments, and treatments efficiently. Additionally, it provides data-driven insights to help clinics better understand their operations and patient trends.

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript.
- Next.js.
- Tailwind CSS.
