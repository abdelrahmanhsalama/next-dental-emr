# Next Dental EMR
## Nickname: Ibtesama: A smile, in Arabic.

This project demonstrates the two fields I have experience in - frontend web development, which I’ve studied for nearly two years, and health informatics, the field I got training in.

Next Dental EMR is a dental electronic medical records (EMR) application built with Next.js. It enables dental teams to manage patients’ records, appointments, and treatments efficiently. Additionally, in the future, it should provide data-driven insights to help clinics better understand their operations and patient trends.
